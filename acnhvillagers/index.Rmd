**Animal Crossing: New Horizons** is a life simulation game developed and published 
by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch, and the fifth main entry in the *Animal 
Crossing* series.  The game went viral from its release during the global 
stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the game, players create and control their character who lives on an initially 
remote island with anthropomorphic animal neighbors.  The player has near total 
control over the development of the island into a small community, and with 
enough dedication and luck, can invite their favorite or "dream villagers" to live on their 
island to complete one part their ideal community.
